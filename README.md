# Commerce-ial-Revolution

## Description

- This project utilizes Express.js, Sequelize, and mySQL to create the back-end of an e-commerce site through Obeject-Relational Mapping in place of writing SQL queries to manipulate the given data.

- Upon sourcing the schema, and running the seeds, the express routes get the data, specific data, insert new data, updates current data, and deletes specific data when ran on Insomnia.

- This project helps to better understand how Object Relational Mapping structures the database and how it can be manipulated.
